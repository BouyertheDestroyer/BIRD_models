Our game offers a unique opportunity for model makers to earn revenue from their creations. We value the creativity of our community, and to support that, we share a portion of the revenue with anyone who adds a model to BIRD.

## How it Works

Once every week, every model maker receives the sum of
- 200 robux if they made a new public model in the past week
- An amount of robux calculated from how many times each of their models was used in the past week (details below)

The payout for everyone at the same time, usually on Sundays. When the payout has been made, we post a summary in discord for transparency. Here's an example of Robux distributed in a past week. The 16 most-inserted model makers earned over 1k robux each this week.

## Payout Calculation

Each model earns an amount of robux calculated from how many times it was used.

We have a pool of 40k robux each week. A specific model earns robux equal to the total 40k pool * ( number of times the model was used / number of times all models were used ), considering uses only from the past week.

We post top model usage summaries in the discord. Here's an example from a previous week. The vertical axis is the number of sessions the model was used in.

## Tips

We notice a few patterns that may be helpful for making popular models and earning more robux.
- Popular models tend to have good thumbnails. Taking time to upload an image for your thumbnail may be better than using an auto-generated thumbnail.
- Popular models tend to be uniquely made for BIRD. They have novel ideas and scripted interactions.
- Top earning model makers have built up a collection of high quality models. A larger quantity of high quality models tends to earn more than a lower quantity.
