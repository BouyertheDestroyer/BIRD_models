## Model Payouts

BIRD offers a unique opportunity for model makers to earn revenue from their creations on Roblox. We value the creativity of our community and believe they should be compensated for their contributions.

### How Payouts Work

Once every week, every model maker earns the sum of
- 200 robux if they made a new public model in the past week
- An amount of robux calculated from how many times each of their models was used in the past week (details below)

The payout happens for everyone at the same time, usually on Sundays. When the payout has been made, we post a summary in discord for transparency. Here's an example of Robux distributed in a prior week. The 16 most-inserted model makers earned over 1k robux each.

> **⚠️ Note:** Unfortunately, we can't distribute earned robux to everyone every week.
> 
> There are over 150 model-makers earning robux every week, so we don't have time to pay everyone.
> We distribute robux to the 50 model makers who've earned the most, and store the rest as a credit.
> This credit adds up each week until a model maker is in the top 50 of owed robux. On that week, we send them their robux and reset their credit.

### Payout Calculation

Each model earns an amount of robux calculated from how many times it was used.

We have a pool of 40k robux each week. A specific model earns robux equal to the total 40k pool * ( number of times the model was used / number of times all models were used ), considering uses only from the past week.

We post top model usage summaries in the discord. Here's an example from a previous week. The vertical axis is the number of sessions the model was used in.

### Tips

We notice a few patterns that may be helpful for making popular models and earning more robux.
- Popular models tend to have good thumbnails. Taking time to upload an image for your thumbnail may be better than using an auto-generated thumbnail.
- Top earning model makers tend to have a large quantity of models. Each model earns robux, so having more models adds up.

Here are the most popular models of August 2024. We sometimes discuss patterns of successful models and model makers in the discord.
