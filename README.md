# BIRD models

Insert models from Roblox Studio to BIRD private servers.

View the instructions for inserting a model directly from within BIRD.

> [!WARNING]  
> As of December 9, there are new instructions for creating models directly in BIRD. View them directly in-game.

## BIRD systems

BIRD has systems that add functionality and interaction. See ![BIRDsystems](BIRDsystems.md) to make models that interact with bird grabbing, squawking, fire, prop respawning, and more.

## Legacy Models

Prior to December 9, 2023, models were made ![with the old instructions](LegacyInstructions.md). However, these models will eventually no longer be supported. Use the instructions in-game.
