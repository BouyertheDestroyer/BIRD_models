# BIRD models

Create models in Roblox Studio and use them in the game [BIRD](https://www.roblox.com/games/3633505977/BIRD).

To create a model, edit our [template place](https://www.roblox.com/games/16445466869/Model-Examples). The place includes instructions to publish your model to the Roblox Toolbox then register it in BIRD.

See [BIRD Systems](BIRDsystems.md) and [Map Models](MapModels.md) to make advanced models.
