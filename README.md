# BIRD models

Insert models from Roblox Studio to [BIRD](https://www.roblox.com/games/3633505977/BIRD) private servers.

View the instructions for inserting a model directly from within BIRD.

## BIRD systems

BIRD has systems that add functionality and interaction. See ![BIRDsystems](BIRDsystems.md) to make models that interact with bird grabbing, squawking, fire, prop respawning, and more.
